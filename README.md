# sam_alluvial_tutorial
A tutorial for creating an Alluvial plot in R using a dataset collected by a student support program. The `sam_data.RMD` file has all that is needed to run the tutorial and create the amazing plot. 

`sam_data.pdf` is simply created by knitting the RMD to PDF. The PDF for this project is included in the repository for easy access.
